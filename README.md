# UART Packet Format of TMYTEK UD Box
![](https://github.com/tmytek/ud-api/images/UART_CMD_format.png)

Both Tx/Rx packets follows the format showed above.
The packet length is 10 bytes.
# Length
The length is counting from frame header to checksum.

# Cmd type

## 0x00
The packet returned from UD Box to denote UD recived “correct” command format.
## 0x01
### Function: Set frequency in kHz resolution
### Data payload
* Low byte of target frequency in kHz
* Mid byte of target frequency in kHz
* High byte of target frequency in kHz
* Highest byte of target frequency in kHz
* For the future developed 
## 0x02
### Function: Set default frequency 
### Data payload
* Low byte of target frequency in kHz
* Mid byte of target frequency in kHz
* High byte of target frequency in kHz
* Highest byte of target frequency in kHz
* For the future developed 

## 0xFF
The packet returned from UD Box to denote UD recived “incorrect” command format.

## LRC
For every Tx pakcet user needs to prepare LRC checksum before sending the command to UD Box.
The LRC is generated by frame header and data payload only.

## Avoid harmonic frequency
UDBox frequency , RF , IF settings will cause harmonic frequency problem by following situation

pseudo code

```
uint8_t LRC(uint8_t *msgPtr, uint8_t len)
{
  uint8_t mLRC = 0;
  for each element in msgPtr
  {
    mLRC += each element in msgPtr
  }
  return ((uint8_t)(-((uint8_t)mLRC))); // two's complement
}
```
